                    <p>Thailand</p>
                    <p>In November of 2019 my wife and I went to Thailand with some family friends. We spent two weeks running around the country trying to see everything we possibly could. Which was exhausting but really amazing. We spent a day at an elephent sanctuary, went out to amazing little islands, and saw a ton of temples which are extremely extravagant.</p>

                    <p>2018 was an eventful year. At the beginning of the year my wife and I went to Hawaii which was beautiful. I was able to go from doing IT for a small company to working on data storage appliances at Dell EMC and my wife and I decided to get a dog.</p>

                        <p>In the summer of 2017 my now wife and I took a ferry out to santa cruz island where I waited for sunset to propose to her. Thankfully she said yes and later that year on December 9th we were married. </p>

                    <p>Not very long after my now wife and I started dating she went to Ecuador for a few months to visit her extended family that lives over there and I was lucky enough to take some time off work to go and explore a really beutiful country with her and meet her grandma and cousins.</p>
